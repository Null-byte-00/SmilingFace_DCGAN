# Simple DCGAN model for generating smiling face images
this is a simple deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) for generating smiling face images. 
## the dataset
dataset consists of 400, 61x61 greyscale images that i drew myself.
you can download the dataset from here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/0x00official/smilingfaces/
## training 
I trained the model on my own GPU. for about 30 epochs. you can download the trained model from the release page
## Results 
I couldn't generate results that are completely indistinguishable from the actual images. This is the best results I could get:
